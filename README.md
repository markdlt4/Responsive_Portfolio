# Responsive_Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, I may be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. 

Delivery Guidelines 

* I Created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, I developed my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio minimizes the use of media queries.
