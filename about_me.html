        I'm Mark Toups, originally from a small town in South Louisiana. After High School graduation, I enlisted into The
        United States Army as a Cav Scout. I completed training and quickly deployed to Iraq, where I served the next 15
        months. Once I finished my combat tour, I returned home and began working part time as a bartender. Which inspired a real love for food and
        beverage, particularly cooking, so much I decided to degree in it. Three years later I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu and began my cooking career. 
        After years of climbing the ranks in kitchens while perfecting my craft, I began to challenge
        myself more, which lead to the creation of my first business. I accomplished things while holding a full time position as Executive Chef for a restaurant
        group. In the development phases of the business, I really found joy in the creation of the digital side of things. I truly
        enjoyed working with developers when designing our website as well as the social media accounts. I also experienced just how important these tools are towards the success of  
        the business. Now with the training I'll get from The University of Texas Coding Bootcamp I've decided to set some new goals. I envision combining my vast knowledge and experience 
        in Culinary Arts, with my passion for web development and digital marketing, to hopefully progress and benefit the near future of the food and beverage industry.
